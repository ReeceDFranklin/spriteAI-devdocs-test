# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/src/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is used to convert an image's pixel format from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red). Here's a concise explanation:

1. It scans through each pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values to AGBR order.
4. The function modifies the image data in-place, changing the order of color channels.
5. Finally, it returns the modified bitmap data of the image.

This transformation can be useful in certain image processing scenarios or when working with specific image formats that require the AGBR pixel arrangement.

### Third Party Libaries

The `toAGBR` function itself doesn't directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it appears to be using methods (`scan` and accessing `bitmap`) that are likely part of a larger image processing library or framework.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Assuming the toAGBR function is defined as shown in your provided code

// Load an image
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image to AGBR format
    const agbrBitmap = toAGBR(image);

    // Create a new Jimp image from the AGBR bitmap
    const agbrImage = new Jimp({
      data: agbrBitmap.data,
      width: agbrBitmap.width,
      height: agbrBitmap.height
    });

    // Save the AGBR image
    agbrImage.write('path/to/output/agbr_image.png', (err) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log('AGBR image saved successfully!');
    });
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

This example does the following:

1. We use the Jimp library to load an image file.
2. Once the image is loaded, we call the `toAGBR` function to convert the image data to the AGBR format.
3. We create a new Jimp image using the converted AGBR bitmap data.
4. Finally, we save the new AGBR image to a file.

Make sure you have the Jimp library installed (`npm install jimp`) and that the `toAGBR` function is available in your code. Also, replace `'path/to/your/image.png'` with the actual path to your input image, and `'path/to/output/agbr_image.png'` with your desired output path.

This example demonstrates how to apply the `toAGBR` function to an image and save the result. You can modify this code to fit your specific use case or integrate it into a larger application as needed.

# fromAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/src/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `fromAGBR` function is used to convert an image from AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) color format to RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color format. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes a bitmap as input.
2. It uses a `scan` function (not shown in the snippet) to iterate over each pixel of the image.
3. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the AGBR values from the input bitmap data.
   - Rearranges these values to RGBA order in the output.
   - Sets the alpha channel to the original alpha value if the bitmap has an alpha channel, or to fully opaque (255) if it doesn't.
4. The function returns the modified bitmap with the color channels now in RGBA order.

This conversion is useful when working with image data that's in AGBR format but needs to be in the more common RGBA format for further processing or display.

### Third Party Libaries

The `fromAGBR` function does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it does call a `scan` function which is likely part of a larger image processing library or framework.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `fromAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

async function convertImage() {
  try {
    // Load an image in AGBR format
    const image = await Jimp.read('path/to/your/agbr_image.png');

    // Convert the image from AGBR to RGBA
    const convertedImage = fromAGBR(image);

    // Save the converted image
    await convertedImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/rgba_image.png');

    console.log('Image converted successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error converting image:', error);
  }
}

convertImage();
```

In this example:

1. We import the Jimp library, which is commonly used for image processing in Node.js.

2. We define an async function `convertImage()` to handle the image conversion process.

3. We use `Jimp.read()` to load an image file that is in AGBR format.

4. We call the `fromAGBR()` function, passing the loaded image as an argument. This function converts the image data from AGBR to RGBA format.

5. We save the converted image using the `writeAsync()` method.

6. Finally, we call the `convertImage()` function to execute the conversion process.

Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/agbr_image.png'` with the actual path to your AGBR format image, and `'path/to/output/rgba_image.png'` with the desired output path for the converted RGBA image.

Also, ensure that the `fromAGBR` function is properly imported or defined in your script before using it.
