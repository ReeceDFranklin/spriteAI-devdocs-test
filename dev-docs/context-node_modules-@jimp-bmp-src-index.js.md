# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/src/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is transforming the color format of an image from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red). 

Here's what it does:

1. It scans through every pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values from the image data.
3. It then rearranges these values, writing them back in AGBR order.

This transformation effectively swaps the positions of the alpha and red channels while keeping green and blue in their original positions. The function returns the modified bitmap data of the image after this color format conversion.

### Third Party Libaries

The `toAGBR` function itself doesn't directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it appears to be using methods (`scan` and accessing `bitmap`) that are likely part of an image processing library, possibly Jimp.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Function definition (the one you provided)
function toAGBR(image) {
  // ... (your existing toAGBR function code)
}

// Example usage
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image to AGBR format
    const agbrBitmap = toAGBR(image);

    // Create a new Jimp image from the AGBR bitmap
    const agbrImage = new Jimp({
      data: agbrBitmap.data,
      width: agbrBitmap.width,
      height: agbrBitmap.height
    });

    // Save the AGBR image
    return agbrImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/agbr_image.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('AGBR image saved successfully');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We import the Jimp library, which is required for image processing.
2. We define the `toAGBR` function (which you've already provided).
3. We use `Jimp.read()` to load an image file.
4. Once the image is loaded, we call the `toAGBR` function to convert it to AGBR format.
5. We create a new Jimp image from the resulting AGBR bitmap.
6. We save the new AGBR image to a file.
7. We handle any errors that might occur during the process.

Make sure you have the Jimp library installed (`npm install jimp`) before running this code. Also, replace `'path/to/your/image.png'` with the actual path to your input image, and `'path/to/output/agbr_image.png'` with the desired output path for the AGBR image.
