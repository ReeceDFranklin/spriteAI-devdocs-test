## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is transforming an image's pixel data from the RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color format to the AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) format. Here's what it does:

1. It scans through each pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values, writing them back in AGBR order.
4. This process is applied to the entire image.

The function effectively swaps the positions of the Red and Alpha channels while keeping Green and Blue in their original positions. This can be useful for certain image processing tasks or when working with specific image formats that require this color arrangement.

### Third Party Libaries

The `toAGBR` function itself does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it appears to be using a `scan` function and accessing a `bitmap` property, which suggests it's likely part of or working with an image processing library or framework.

### Third Party Libaries

The `fromAGBR` function does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries; it appears to be using a custom `scan` function and manipulating bitmap data directly.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `fromAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Assuming you have the fromAGBR function defined

// Load an image in AGBR format
Jimp.read('path/to/your/agbr_image.png')
  .then((image) => {
    // Convert the image from AGBR to RGBA
    const rgbaImage = fromAGBR(image);

    // Now you can work with the RGBA image
    // For example, you can save it
    return rgbaImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/rgba_image.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image conversion completed successfully');
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We use the Jimp library to read an image file that's in AGBR format.

2. Once the image is loaded, we pass it to the `fromAGBR` function. This function converts the image data from AGBR to RGBA format.

3. The `fromAGBR` function returns a new bitmap with the converted data.

4. We can then use this converted image for further processing or save it to a file.

5. In this example, we're saving the converted image to a new file.

Remember to handle any potential errors that might occur during the process.

Note that this example assumes you're using the Jimp library for image processing. If you're using a different library or method to handle bitmap data, you might need to adjust the code accordingly.
