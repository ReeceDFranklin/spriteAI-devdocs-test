# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/src/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is a transformation function that converts an image's color format from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red).

Here's what it does:

1. It scans through each pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values to AGBR order.
4. The transformed data is written back to the image's bitmap.

This transformation can be useful in certain image processing scenarios or when working with specific image formats that require the AGBR color order.

### Third Party Libaries

The `toAGBR` function does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it appears to be part of or using a larger image processing library or framework that provides the `scan` method and the `bitmap` property structure.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief example of how you might use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Function to convert image to AGBR format
function toAGBR(image) {
  // ... (your existing toAGBR function code here)
}

// Usage example
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image to AGBR format
    const agbrImage = toAGBR(image);

    // Create a new Jimp image from the AGBR bitmap
    const convertedImage = new Jimp({
      data: agbrImage.data,
      width: agbrImage.width,
      height: agbrImage.height
    });

    // Save the converted image
    return convertedImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/agbr_image.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image converted and saved successfully!');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We use the Jimp library to read an image file.
2. We apply the `toAGBR` function to convert the image to the AGBR format.
3. We create a new Jimp image from the converted bitmap data.
4. We save the new image to a file.

Make sure you have the Jimp library installed (`npm install jimp`) before running this code.

Also, note that the `scan` function used in `toAGBR` is typically a method provided by image processing libraries like Jimp. If you're using a different library, you might need to adjust the `toAGBR` function accordingly.

# fromAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/src/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `fromAGBR` function is designed to convert an image from the AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) color format to the more common RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) format. Here's what it does:

1. It takes a `bitmap` object as input.
2. It uses a `scan` function (not shown in the snippet) to iterate over every pixel in the image.
3. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the AGBR values from the input bitmap data.
   - Rearranges these values to RGBA order.
   - Writes the rearranged values back to the bitmap data.
4. If the original bitmap doesn't have an alpha channel (`!bitmap.is_with_alpha`), it sets the alpha value to 255 (fully opaque).
5. Finally, it returns the modified bitmap with the color channels now in RGBA order.

This function is useful when working with image data that's in the less common AGBR format and needs to be converted to the standard RGBA format for further processing or display.

### Third Party Libaries

The `fromAGBR` function does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it does call a `scan` function, which is likely part of a larger image processing library or framework that this code is using.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `fromAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Assuming you have the fromAGBR function defined as shown in your provided code

// Load an image in AGBR format
Jimp.read('path/to/your/agbr_image.png')
  .then((image) => {
    // Convert the image from AGBR to RGBA
    const rgbaImage = fromAGBR(image);

    // Now you can work with the RGBA image
    // For example, you can save it
    return rgbaImage.writeAsync('path/to/save/rgba_image.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image successfully converted and saved!');
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We use the Jimp library to read an image file that's in AGBR format.

2. We pass the loaded image to the `fromAGBR` function, which converts it from AGBR to RGBA format.

3. The function returns the converted image, which we can then manipulate or save.

4. In this case, we're saving the converted image to a new file.

Note that this example assumes you're using Jimp for image manipulation. If you're using a different library, the exact method for loading and saving images might be different, but the core usage of `fromAGBR` would remain the same.

Also, make sure that the `fromAGBR` function and any dependencies (like the `scan` function it uses) are properly defined and accessible in your code.
