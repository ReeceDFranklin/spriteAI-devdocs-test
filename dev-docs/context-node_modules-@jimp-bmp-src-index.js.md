# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/src/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is a transformation function that converts an image's color format from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red).

Here's what it does:

1. It scans through each pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values to AGBR order.
4. The transformed data is written back to the image's bitmap.

This transformation can be useful in certain image processing scenarios or when working with specific image formats that require the AGBR color order.

### Third Party Libaries

The `toAGBR` function does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it appears to be part of or using a larger image processing library or framework that provides the `scan` method and the `bitmap` property structure.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief example of how you might use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Function to convert image to AGBR format
function toAGBR(image) {
  // ... (your existing toAGBR function code here)
}

// Usage example
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image to AGBR format
    const agbrImage = toAGBR(image);

    // Create a new Jimp image from the AGBR bitmap
    const convertedImage = new Jimp({
      data: agbrImage.data,
      width: agbrImage.width,
      height: agbrImage.height
    });

    // Save the converted image
    return convertedImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/agbr_image.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image converted and saved successfully!');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We use the Jimp library to read an image file.
2. We apply the `toAGBR` function to convert the image to the AGBR format.
3. We create a new Jimp image from the converted bitmap data.
4. We save the new image to a file.

Make sure you have the Jimp library installed (`npm install jimp`) before running this code.

Also, note that the `scan` function used in `toAGBR` is typically a method provided by image processing libraries like Jimp. If you're using a different library, you might need to adjust the `toAGBR` function accordingly.

# fromAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/src/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `fromAGBR` function in this code snippet is designed to convert an image from AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) color format to RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) format. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes a `bitmap` object as input.
2. It uses a `scan` function (not shown in the snippet) to iterate through each pixel of the image.
3. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the AGBR values from the input bitmap data.
   - Rearranges these values to RGBA order.
   - Writes the rearranged values back to the bitmap data.
4. If the original bitmap has an alpha channel, it preserves it; otherwise, it sets full opacity (0xff).
5. Finally, it returns the modified bitmap with the color channels now in RGBA order.

This function essentially performs a color space conversion, changing the order of color components in the image data.

### Third Party Libaries

The `fromAGBR` function does not appear to use any third-party APIs or libraries directly; it relies on a `scan` function (which is likely part of the same library or codebase) and manipulates bitmap data directly.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `fromAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

async function convertImage() {
  try {
    // Load an image in AGBR format
    const image = await Jimp.read('path/to/your/agbr_image.png');

    // Apply the fromAGBR function to convert the image
    const convertedImage = fromAGBR(image);

    // Save the converted image
    await convertedImage.writeAsync('path/to/save/converted_image.png');

    console.log('Image conversion completed successfully.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error converting image:', error);
  }
}

convertImage();
```

In this example:

1. We import the Jimp library, which is commonly used for image processing in Node.js.

2. We define an async function `convertImage()` to handle the image conversion process.

3. Inside the function, we use `Jimp.read()` to load an image file that is in AGBR format.

4. We then call the `fromAGBR()` function, passing the loaded image as an argument. This function converts the image from AGBR to RGBA format.

5. After conversion, we save the resulting image using the `writeAsync()` method.

6. Finally, we call the `convertImage()` function to execute the conversion process.

Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/agbr_image.png'` with the actual path to your AGBR format image, and `'path/to/save/converted_image.png'` with the desired path and filename for the converted image.

Also, ensure that you have the Jimp library installed in your project (`npm install jimp`) before running this code.
