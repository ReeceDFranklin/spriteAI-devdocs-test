## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is transforming an image's pixel data from the RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color format to the AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) format. Here's what it does:

1. It scans through each pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values, writing them back in AGBR order.
4. This process is applied to the entire image.

The function effectively swaps the positions of the Red and Alpha channels while keeping Green and Blue in their original positions. This can be useful for certain image processing tasks or when working with specific image formats that require this color arrangement.

### Third Party Libaries

The `toAGBR` function itself does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it appears to be using a `scan` function and accessing a `bitmap` property, which suggests it's likely part of or working with an image processing library or framework.
