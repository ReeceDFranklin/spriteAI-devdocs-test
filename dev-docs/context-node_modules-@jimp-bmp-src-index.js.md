# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/src/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is converting an image from the standard RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color format to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) format. Here's what it does:

1. It uses a `scan` function (likely from an image processing library) to iterate over each pixel of the image.

2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values from the image's bitmap data.

3. It then rearranges these values, writing them back to the bitmap in AGBR order:
   - Alpha becomes the first channel
   - Blue becomes the second channel
   - Green becomes the third channel
   - Red becomes the last channel

4. After processing all pixels, it returns the modified bitmap data.

This transformation can be useful in certain image processing scenarios or when working with specific file formats or systems that expect image data in AGBR format.

### Third Party Libaries

The `toAGBR` function doesn't directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it appears to be part of a larger image processing library or framework that provides the `scan` method and the `bitmap` structure.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief example of how you might use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Assuming the toAGBR function is defined as you've shown

async function convertImageToAGBR(inputPath, outputPath) {
  try {
    // Read the image
    const image = await Jimp.read(inputPath);

    // Apply the toAGBR conversion
    const agbrBitmap = toAGBR(image);

    // Create a new Jimp image from the converted bitmap
    const convertedImage = new Jimp(agbrBitmap);

    // Save the converted image
    await convertedImage.writeAsync(outputPath);

    console.log('Image converted and saved successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error converting image:', error);
  }
}

// Usage
const inputImagePath = 'path/to/input/image.png';
const outputImagePath = 'path/to/output/image_agbr.png';

convertImageToAGBR(inputImagePath, outputImagePath);
```

In this example:

1. We import the Jimp library, which is commonly used for image processing in Node.js.

2. We define an async function `convertImageToAGBR` that takes an input image path and an output image path.

3. Inside this function, we:
   - Read the input image using `Jimp.read()`.
   - Apply the `toAGBR` conversion to the image.
   - Create a new Jimp image from the converted bitmap.
   - Save the converted image to the specified output path.

4. We then call this function with the paths to our input and output images.

Note that this example assumes you're using Node.js and have the Jimp library installed (`npm install jimp`). Also, make sure that the `scan` function used in `toAGBR` is available in your environment (it's typically a method provided by image processing libraries like Jimp).

Remember to handle any potential errors and adjust the file paths according to your project structure.
