# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/src/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is used to convert an image's pixel format from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red). Here's a concise explanation:

1. It scans through each pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then reorders these values to AGBR format.
4. The function returns the modified bitmap data with the new pixel format.

This transformation can be useful in certain image processing tasks or when working with specific file formats or systems that expect image data in AGBR format.

### Third Party Libaries

The function `toAGBR` does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it appears to be using a `scan` function and accessing a `bitmap` property, which suggests it may be part of or relying on a larger image processing library or framework.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Assuming you have the toAGBR function defined as shown in your original code

// Load an image
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Apply the toAGBR transformation
    const agbrBitmap = toAGBR(image);

    // Create a new Jimp image from the transformed bitmap
    const agbrImage = new Jimp({
      data: agbrBitmap.data,
      width: agbrBitmap.width,
      height: agbrBitmap.height
    });

    // Save the transformed image
    return agbrImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/agbr_image.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('AGBR transformation complete and image saved.');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

This example does the following:

1. It uses the Jimp library to load an image.
2. After the image is loaded, it applies the `toAGBR` transformation to the image.
3. It creates a new Jimp image from the transformed bitmap data.
4. Finally, it saves the transformed image to a new file.

Make sure you have the Jimp library installed (`npm install jimp`) and that the `toAGBR` function is defined in your code. Also, replace 'path/to/your/image.png' with the actual path to your input image, and 'path/to/output/agbr_image.png' with the desired output path.

This code assumes that the `scan` function used in `toAGBR` is a method of the Jimp image object. If it's not, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

# fromAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/src/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `fromAGBR` function in this code snippet is designed to convert an image from AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) color format to RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) format. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes a `bitmap` object as input.
2. It uses a `scan` function (not shown in the snippet) to iterate through each pixel of the image.
3. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the AGBR values from the input bitmap data.
   - Rearranges these values to RGBA order.
   - Writes the rearranged values back to the bitmap data.
4. If the original bitmap has an alpha channel, it preserves it; otherwise, it sets full opacity (0xff).
5. Finally, it returns the modified bitmap with the color channels now in RGBA order.

This function essentially performs a color space conversion, changing the order of color components in the image data.

### Third Party Libaries

The `fromAGBR` function does not appear to use any third-party APIs or libraries directly; it relies on a `scan` function (which is likely part of the same library or codebase) and manipulates bitmap data directly.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `fromAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

async function convertImage() {
  try {
    // Load an image in AGBR format
    const image = await Jimp.read('path/to/your/agbr_image.png');

    // Apply the fromAGBR function to convert the image
    const convertedImage = fromAGBR(image);

    // Save the converted image
    await convertedImage.writeAsync('path/to/save/converted_image.png');

    console.log('Image conversion completed successfully.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error converting image:', error);
  }
}

convertImage();
```

In this example:

1. We import the Jimp library, which is commonly used for image processing in Node.js.

2. We define an async function `convertImage()` to handle the image conversion process.

3. Inside the function, we use `Jimp.read()` to load an image file that is in AGBR format.

4. We then call the `fromAGBR()` function, passing the loaded image as an argument. This function converts the image from AGBR to RGBA format.

5. After conversion, we save the resulting image using the `writeAsync()` method.

6. Finally, we call the `convertImage()` function to execute the conversion process.

Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/agbr_image.png'` with the actual path to your AGBR format image, and `'path/to/save/converted_image.png'` with the desired path and filename for the converted image.

Also, ensure that you have the Jimp library installed in your project (`npm install jimp`) before running this code.
