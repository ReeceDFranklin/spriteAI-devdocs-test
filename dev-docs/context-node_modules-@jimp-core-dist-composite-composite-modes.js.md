# srcOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `srcOver` function in this code snippet implements the "source over" alpha compositing operation, which is a common method for blending two colors with transparency. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes two color objects (`src` and `dst`) with RGBA values and an optional opacity parameter (`ops`).
2. It adjusts the source alpha based on the opacity.
3. It calculates the resulting alpha value by combining the source and destination alphas.
4. For each color channel (R, G, B), it computes the blended value using the formula: (source * source_alpha + destination * destination_alpha * (1 - source_alpha)) / resulting_alpha.
5. It returns a new color object with the blended RGBA values.

This function essentially determines how a new color (source) should be composited on top of an existing color (destination), taking into account their transparency levels.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it's a pure JavaScript implementation of the "source over" blending mode using basic arithmetic operations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief example of how to use the `srcOver` function:

```javascript
// Define two colors: a source color and a destination color
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Solid blue

// Call the srcOver function to blend the colors
const blendedColor = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log(blendedColor);
```

In this example:

1. We define two colors:
   - `sourceColor`: A semi-transparent red (rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5))
   - `destColor`: A solid blue (rgba(0, 0, 255, 1))

2. We call the `srcOver` function, passing the source color and destination color as arguments.

3. The function calculates the blended color using the "source over" compositing operation.

4. The result is stored in `blendedColor`, which will be an object containing the r, g, b, and a values of the resulting color.

5. We log the result to the console.

The output will be an object representing the blended color, with values for red, green, blue, and alpha channels.

You can also use the optional third parameter `ops` to adjust the opacity of the source color before blending:

```javascript
const blendedColorWithReducedOpacity = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor, 0.7);
```

This would reduce the opacity of the source color to 70% before blending.

# dstOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! In this code snippet, `dstOver` is a function that implements the "destination-over" blending mode for compositing two colors or images.

Here's a concise explanation:

1. The function takes two parameters: `src` (source color) and `dst` (destination color).
2. An optional third parameter `ops` (opacity) is provided, defaulting to 1 if not specified.
3. It adjusts the source alpha (`src.a`) by multiplying it with the opacity.
4. It then calculates the resulting color components (r, g, b, a) using the destination-over blending formula.
5. The formula ensures that the source color is placed "behind" the destination color, with proper alpha blending.
6. Finally, it returns an object with the calculated r, g, b, and a values.

This function is useful in graphics programming and image manipulation when you need to blend colors or layers using the destination-over compositing method.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it performs simple arithmetic operations using standard JavaScript syntax and features.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `dstOver` function:

```javascript
// Define source and destination colors
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Opaque blue

// Call the dstOver function
const result = dstOver(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log("Resulting color:", result);

// You can also specify an optional opacity value
const resultWithCustomOpacity = dstOver(sourceColor, destColor, 0.8);
console.log("Result with custom opacity:", resultWithCustomOpacity);
```

In this example:

1. We define two colors: a semi-transparent red (`sourceColor`) and an opaque blue (`destColor`).

2. We call the `dstOver` function with these two colors as arguments.

3. The function returns a new color object representing the result of the "destination over" composition.

4. We log the result to the console.

5. We also demonstrate how to use the optional third parameter (`ops`) by calling the function again with a custom opacity value of 0.8.

The `dstOver` function implements the "destination over" compositing operation, where the source color is placed behind the destination color. The resulting color takes into account the alpha values of both colors to create a blended result.

Remember that this function expects color objects with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties, where `r`, `g`, and `b` are typically in the range 0-255, and `a` is in the range 0-1.

# multiply node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `multiply` is a function that performs a blend operation between two color values (`src` and `dst`) using the multiply blending mode. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes two objects (`src` and `dst`) representing colors with RGBA components.
2. An optional `ops` parameter controls the intensity of the blending.
3. It calculates the resulting alpha value and pre-multiplied color components.
4. The function applies the multiply blending formula to each color channel (R, G, B).
5. Finally, it returns a new object with the blended RGBA values.

This function is typically used in image processing or graphics programming to combine colors using the multiply blending mode, which generally results in a darker image.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it performs calculations using only native JavaScript operations and object properties.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `multiply` function:

```javascript
// Define two color objects (source and destination)
const sourceColor = { r: 0.8, g: 0.5, b: 0.2, a: 0.7 };
const destColor = { r: 0.3, g: 0.6, b: 0.9, a: 0.8 };

// Call the multiply function
const result = multiply(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log(result);

// You can also use the optional third parameter (ops)
const resultWithOps = multiply(sourceColor, destColor, 1.5);
console.log(resultWithOps);
```

In this example:

1. We define two color objects, `sourceColor` and `destColor`, each with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties representing red, green, blue, and alpha channels respectively. Values should be between 0 and 1.

2. We call the `multiply` function with `sourceColor` as the first argument and `destColor` as the second argument.

3. The function returns a new color object, which we store in the `result` variable and then log to the console.

4. We also demonstrate using the optional third parameter `ops` by calling the function again with a value of 1.5.

This code will apply the multiply blending mode to the two input colors and return the resulting color. The `ops` parameter can be used to adjust the opacity of the source color before blending.
