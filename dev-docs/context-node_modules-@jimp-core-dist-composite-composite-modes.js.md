### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `srcOver` function:

```javascript
// Define two colors: a source color and a destination color
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Opaque blue

// Call the srcOver function to blend the colors
const result = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log("Blended color:", result);

// You can also specify an optional opacity value (default is 1)
const resultWithOpacity = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor, 0.8);

console.log("Blended color with custom opacity:", resultWithOpacity);
```

In this example:

1. We define two colors: a semi-transparent red (`sourceColor`) and an opaque blue (`destColor`).

2. We call the `srcOver` function with these two colors to blend them. The source color is overlaid on top of the destination color.

3. The result is logged to the console, showing the RGBA values of the blended color.

4. We then demonstrate using the optional third parameter to adjust the opacity of the source color before blending. In this case, we set it to 0.8, which will make the source color slightly more transparent before blending.

5. The result of this second blend is also logged to the console.

This function is useful in graphics programming, particularly when working with alpha compositing or when you need to blend colors in various ways, such as in image processing or creating visual effects.

# dstOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! In this code snippet, `dstOver` is a function that implements the "destination-over" blending mode for compositing two colors or images.

The function takes two main parameters:
1. `src`: The source color (foreground)
2. `dst`: The destination color (background)

It also has an optional third parameter `ops` (opacity) with a default value of 1.

The function calculates the resulting color by blending the source color over the destination color, taking into account their alpha (transparency) values. It uses the formula for the "destination-over" compositing operation, which places the source color behind the destination color.

The function returns an object with the resulting `r` (red), `g` (green), `b` (blue), and `a` (alpha) values of the blended color.

# multiply node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `multiply` is a function that performs a blend operation between two color values (`src` and `dst`) using the multiply blending mode. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes two objects (`src` and `dst`) representing colors with RGBA components.
2. An optional `ops` parameter controls the intensity of the blending.
3. It calculates the resulting alpha value and pre-multiplied color components.
4. The function applies the multiply blending formula to each color channel (R, G, B).
5. Finally, it returns a new object with the blended RGBA values.

This function is typically used in image processing or graphics programming to combine colors using the multiply blending mode, which generally results in a darker image.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it performs calculations using only native JavaScript operations and object properties.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `multiply` function:

```javascript
// Define two color objects (source and destination)
const sourceColor = { r: 0.8, g: 0.5, b: 0.2, a: 0.7 };
const destColor = { r: 0.3, g: 0.6, b: 0.9, a: 0.8 };

// Call the multiply function
const result = multiply(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log(result);

// You can also use the optional third parameter (ops)
const resultWithOps = multiply(sourceColor, destColor, 1.5);
console.log(resultWithOps);
```

In this example:

1. We define two color objects, `sourceColor` and `destColor`, each with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties representing red, green, blue, and alpha channels respectively. Values should be between 0 and 1.

2. We call the `multiply` function with `sourceColor` as the first argument and `destColor` as the second argument.

3. The function returns a new color object, which we store in the `result` variable and then log to the console.

4. We also demonstrate using the optional third parameter `ops` by calling the function again with a value of 1.5.

This code will apply the multiply blending mode to the two input colors and return the resulting color. The `ops` parameter can be used to adjust the opacity of the source color before blending.
