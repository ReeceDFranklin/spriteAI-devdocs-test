# srcOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `srcOver` function in this code snippet implements the "source over" alpha compositing operation, which is a common method for blending two images or colors with transparency. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes a source color (`src`) and a destination color (`dst`), both with alpha channels.
2. An optional opacity parameter (`ops`) can be provided to adjust the source alpha.
3. It calculates the resulting color by blending the source and destination based on their alpha values.
4. The function returns a new color object with the blended RGBA values.

This operation is typically used in computer graphics and image processing to combine partially transparent layers or elements.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it's a pure JavaScript implementation of the "source over" alpha compositing operation using basic arithmetic calculations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief example of how to use the `srcOver` function:

```javascript
// Define two colors: source and destination
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Opaque blue

// Call the srcOver function
const result = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log(result);
```

In this example:

1. We define two colors:
   - `sourceColor`: A semi-transparent red (rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5))
   - `destColor`: An opaque blue (rgba(0, 0, 255, 1))

2. We call the `srcOver` function with these two colors as arguments.

3. The function calculates the result of blending the source color over the destination color.

4. We log the result, which will be an object containing the r, g, b, and a values of the resulting color.

You can also use the optional third parameter `ops` to adjust the opacity of the source color before blending:

```javascript
const result = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor, 0.8);
```

This would reduce the opacity of the source color to 80% of its original value before blending.

Remember that this function implements the "source over destination" blending mode, which is a common alpha compositing operation where the source color is placed over the destination color, taking into account the alpha values of both colors.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses basic JavaScript operations and math calculations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `dstOver` function:

```javascript
// Define two color objects with RGBA values
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destinationColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Opaque blue

// Call the dstOver function
const result = dstOver(sourceColor, destinationColor);

// Log the result
console.log(result);
```

In this example:

1. We define two color objects: `sourceColor` (semi-transparent red) and `destinationColor` (opaque blue).

2. We call the `dstOver` function, passing `sourceColor` as the source and `destinationColor` as the destination.

3. The function performs the destination-over compositing operation and returns the resulting color.

4. We log the result to the console.

The `dstOver` function implements the "destination-over" compositing operation, where the source color is composited behind the destination color. The resulting color will be a blend of the two input colors, with the destination color appearing on top of the source color.

Note that the third parameter `ops` is optional and defaults to 1 if not provided. You can include it if you want to adjust the opacity of the source color before compositing:

```javascript
const result = dstOver(sourceColor, destinationColor, 0.8); // Reduce source opacity to 80%
```

This would reduce the opacity of the source color to 80% before performing the compositing operation.
