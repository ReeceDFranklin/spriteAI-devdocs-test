### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `srcOver` function:

```javascript
// Define two colors: a source color and a destination color
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Opaque blue

// Call the srcOver function to blend the colors
const result = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log("Blended color:", result);

// You can also specify an optional opacity value (default is 1)
const resultWithOpacity = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor, 0.8);

console.log("Blended color with custom opacity:", resultWithOpacity);
```

In this example:

1. We define two colors: a semi-transparent red (`sourceColor`) and an opaque blue (`destColor`).

2. We call the `srcOver` function with these two colors to blend them. The source color is overlaid on top of the destination color.

3. The result is logged to the console, showing the RGBA values of the blended color.

4. We then demonstrate using the optional third parameter to adjust the opacity of the source color before blending. In this case, we set it to 0.8, which will make the source color slightly more transparent before blending.

5. The result of this second blend is also logged to the console.

This function is useful in graphics programming, particularly when working with alpha compositing or when you need to blend colors in various ways, such as in image processing or creating visual effects.

# dstOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! In this code snippet, `dstOver` is a function that implements the "destination-over" blending mode for compositing two colors or images.

The function takes two main parameters:
1. `src`: The source color (foreground)
2. `dst`: The destination color (background)

It also has an optional third parameter `ops` (opacity) with a default value of 1.

The function calculates the resulting color by blending the source color over the destination color, taking into account their alpha (transparency) values. It uses the formula for the "destination-over" compositing operation, which places the source color behind the destination color.

The function returns an object with the resulting `r` (red), `g` (green), `b` (blue), and `a` (alpha) values of the blended color.

# multiply node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses standard JavaScript syntax and arithmetic operations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `multiply` function:

```javascript
// Define source and destination colors
const src = { r: 0.5, g: 0.7, b: 0.9, a: 0.8 };
const dst = { r: 0.3, g: 0.5, b: 0.7, a: 0.6 };

// Call the multiply function
const result = multiply(src, dst);

// Log the result
console.log(result);

// You can also use the optional ops parameter
const resultWithOps = multiply(src, dst, 0.5);
console.log(resultWithOps);
```

In this example:

1. We define two color objects, `src` and `dst`, each with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties representing red, green, blue, and alpha channels respectively. Values should be between 0 and 1.

2. We call the `multiply` function with `src` and `dst` as arguments.

3. The function returns a new object with the resulting color after applying the multiply blend mode.

4. We log the result to the console.

5. We also demonstrate using the optional `ops` parameter by calling the function again with a value of 0.5.

Remember that this function modifies the `src` object by multiplying its alpha value with `ops`. If you want to preserve the original `src` object, you should create a copy before passing it to the function.

# add node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `add` function:

```javascript
// Create two color objects
const color1 = { r: 0.5, g: 0.3, b: 0.7, a: 0.8 };
const color2 = { r: 0.2, g: 0.6, b: 0.4, a: 0.5 };

// Call the add function
const result = add(color1, color2);

// Log the result
console.log(result);
```

In this example:

1. We create two color objects, `color1` and `color2`, each with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties representing the red, green, blue, and alpha channels respectively. The values are typically between 0 and 1.

2. We call the `add` function, passing `color1` as the source (`src`) and `color2` as the destination (`dst`).

3. The function returns a new color object with the result of the addition blend mode.

4. We log the result to the console.

You can also use the optional `ops` parameter to adjust the opacity of the source color:

```javascript
// Using the ops parameter
const result = add(color1, color2, 0.5);
```

This would apply the addition blend mode with the source color at 50% opacity.

Remember that this function modifies the `src` object by multiplying its alpha value with `ops`. If you want to preserve the original `src` object, you should create a copy before passing it to the function.

# screen node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `screen` function in this code snippet implements the Screen blending mode, which is commonly used in image processing and graphics applications. Here's a concise explanation:

1. The function takes two color objects (`src` and `dst`) as input, each with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties representing red, green, blue, and alpha channels.

2. It calculates the resulting color by applying the Screen blending formula: Result = 1 - (1 - Source) * (1 - Destination)

3. The function handles alpha blending and pre-multiplied alpha values.

4. It returns a new color object with the blended values for each channel (r, g, b, a).

The Screen blend mode typically results in a lighter image, as it inverts, multiplies, and then inverts the colors again. This mode is often used for adding highlights or brightening images.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it appears to be a self-contained implementation of a screen blending mode using basic JavaScript operations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief example of how to use the `screen` function:

```javascript
// Define two colors: source and destination
const sourceColor = { r: 0.8, g: 0.2, b: 0.5, a: 0.7 };
const destColor = { r: 0.3, g: 0.6, b: 0.1, a: 0.9 };

// Call the screen function
const result = screen(sourceColor, destColor);

// Optional: You can pass a third argument to adjust the opacity
// const result = screen(sourceColor, destColor, 0.5);

// Log the result
console.log("Resulting color:", result);
```

In this example:

1. We define two colors: `sourceColor` and `destColor`. Each color is represented as an object with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties (red, green, blue, and alpha respectively). The values should be between 0 and 1.

2. We call the `screen` function, passing `sourceColor` as the source and `destColor` as the destination.

3. The function returns a new color object, which is the result of applying the screen blending mode to these colors.

4. We log the result to the console.

Note that the `screen` function implements the screen blending mode, which is often used in image editing. It generally results in a brighter image. The exact visual effect will depend on the input colors.

Also, remember that this function operates on individual pixels or colors. If you're working with entire images, you'd typically apply this function to each pixel of the image.

# overlay node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `overlay` function in this code snippet implements the overlay blending mode, which is a common technique used in image processing and graphics manipulation. Here's a concise explanation:

1. The function takes two color objects (`src` and `dst`) as input, representing the source and destination colors.

2. It adjusts the alpha (opacity) of the source color based on an optional `ops` parameter.

3. It calculates the resulting alpha value by combining the source and destination alphas.

4. For each color channel (red, green, blue):
   - If the destination color is dark (2 * channel value <= alpha), it multiplies the colors.
   - If the destination color is light, it uses a screen-like blending.

5. The function returns a new color object with the blended values for each channel (r, g, b) and the resulting alpha (a).

This overlay blending mode creates a contrast effect, enhancing light areas in light colors and dark areas in dark colors, which can be useful for various image editing and compositing tasks.
