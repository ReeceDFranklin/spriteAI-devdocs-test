# srcOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `srcOver` function in this code snippet implements the "source over" alpha compositing operation. This operation is used to blend two colors, typically a source color (src) and a destination color (dst), taking into account their alpha (transparency) values.

Here's a concise explanation:

1. It adjusts the source alpha based on an optional opacity parameter (ops).
2. It calculates the resulting alpha value by combining source and destination alphas.
3. For each color channel (r, g, b), it computes the blended value using the formula:
   (src_channel * src_alpha + dst_channel * dst_alpha * (1 - src_alpha)) / result_alpha
4. It returns an object with the blended r, g, b, and a values.

This function essentially determines how the source color should be composited over the destination color, considering their respective transparencies.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it's a self-contained implementation using only basic JavaScript operations and math.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `srcOver` function:

```javascript
// Define source and destination colors
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Opaque blue

// Call the srcOver function
const result = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log("Resulting color:");
console.log(`R: ${result.r}`);
console.log(`G: ${result.g}`);
console.log(`B: ${result.b}`);
console.log(`A: ${result.a}`);
```

In this example:

1. We define a source color (semi-transparent red) and a destination color (opaque blue).
2. We call the `srcOver` function with these two colors as arguments.
3. The function calculates the result of blending the source color over the destination color.
4. We log the resulting color values.

You can also use the optional `ops` parameter to adjust the opacity of the source color:

```javascript
// Using the ops parameter to adjust source opacity
const result2 = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor, 0.8);

console.log("Result with adjusted opacity:");
console.log(`R: ${result2.r}`);
console.log(`G: ${result2.g}`);
console.log(`B: ${result2.b}`);
console.log(`A: ${result2.a}`);
```

This function is useful for color blending operations, particularly in graphics programming or image processing tasks where you need to composite one color (or image) over another while taking into account transparency.

# dstOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `dstOver` function implements the "destination-over" alpha compositing operation. This operation combines a source image (src) with a destination image (dst) by placing the source image behind the destination image.

Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes two parameters: `src` (source color) and `dst` (destination color).
2. An optional third parameter `ops` controls the opacity of the source.
3. It calculates the resulting color by blending the source and destination based on their alpha values.
4. The function returns an object with the resulting RGBA values.

The formula used ensures that the source color is visible through transparent areas of the destination, while fully opaque areas of the destination remain unchanged. This is useful in image processing and graphics programming for layering images or applying effects.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it's a pure JavaScript implementation of the "destination-over" blending operation using basic arithmetic operations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `dstOver` function:

```javascript
// Define two color objects with RGBA values
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destinationColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Opaque blue

// Call the dstOver function
const result = dstOver(sourceColor, destinationColor);

// Log the result
console.log("Resulting color:");
console.log("R:", result.r);
console.log("G:", result.g);
console.log("B:", result.b);
console.log("A:", result.a);
```

In this example:

1. We define two color objects: `sourceColor` (semi-transparent red) and `destinationColor` (opaque blue).

2. We call the `dstOver` function, passing the source and destination colors as arguments.

3. The function performs the blending operation and returns the resulting color.

4. We log the RGBA values of the resulting color to the console.

You can also use the optional third parameter `ops` to adjust the opacity of the source color:

```javascript
// Using the optional ops parameter
const result = dstOver(sourceColor, destinationColor, 0.8);
```

This would reduce the opacity of the source color to 80% of its original value before blending.

The `dstOver` function implements the "destination-over" compositing operation, where the source color is blended behind the destination color. This is useful in various graphics and image processing scenarios where you need to combine semi-transparent layers.

# multiply node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `multiply` is a function that performs a blend operation similar to the "Multiply" blend mode in image processing. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes two objects (`src` and `dst`) representing source and destination colors, each with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` (alpha) components.

2. An optional `ops` parameter can be provided to adjust the source alpha.

3. The function calculates new color values by multiplying the source and destination colors, considering their alpha channels.

4. It uses a formula that combines the source and destination colors while preserving transparency.

5. The result is a new object with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties representing the blended color.

This function essentially simulates how the "Multiply" blend mode would combine two colors, typically used in image editing software or graphics programming.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this `multiply` function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses basic JavaScript operations and math calculations.

# screen node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `screen` function in this code snippet implements the Screen blending mode, which is commonly used in image processing and computer graphics. Here's a concise explanation:

1. The function takes two color objects (`src` and `dst`) as input, each with r, g, b, and a components.

2. It calculates a new alpha value `a` based on the source and destination alpha values.

3. For each color channel (r, g, b), it applies the Screen blending formula:
   result = 1 - (1 - src) * (1 - dst)

4. The calculation is done while considering the alpha values of both source and destination colors.

5. The function returns a new color object with the blended r, g, b, and a values.

The Screen blend mode typically results in a lighter image, as it inverts, multiplies, and then inverts the colors again. It's often used for creating bright, glowing effects in image compositing.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it appears to be a pure JavaScript implementation of a screen blending operation.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `screen` function:

```javascript
// Define two color objects
const sourceColor = { r: 0.8, g: 0.5, b: 0.2, a: 0.7 };
const destinationColor = { r: 0.3, g: 0.6, b: 0.9, a: 0.8 };

// Call the screen function
const resultColor = screen(sourceColor, destinationColor);

// Log the result
console.log("Result Color:", resultColor);

// You can also specify an optional opacity value (ops)
const resultColorWithOpacity = screen(sourceColor, destinationColor, 0.5);
console.log("Result Color with Opacity:", resultColorWithOpacity);
```

In this example:

1. We define two color objects, `sourceColor` and `destinationColor`, each with red (r), green (g), blue (b), and alpha (a) values ranging from 0 to 1.

2. We call the `screen` function with these two colors as arguments, which applies the screen blending mode to combine them.

3. The result is stored in `resultColor`, which we then log to the console.

4. We also demonstrate how to use the optional third parameter `ops` (opacity) by calling the function again with an opacity value of 0.5.

5. The result of this second call is stored in `resultColorWithOpacity` and logged to the console.

This code will output the resulting colors after applying the screen blending mode. The values in the result will be new r, g, b, and a values representing the blended color.

Remember that this function expects color values to be in the range of 0 to 1, not 0 to 255. If you're working with standard RGB values (0-255), you'll need to normalize them to the 0-1 range before passing them to this function, and then convert them back afterwards if necessary.
