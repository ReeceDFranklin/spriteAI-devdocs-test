# srcOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `srcOver` function implements the "source over" blending mode, which is a common compositing operation in computer graphics. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It blends a source color (`src`) over a destination color (`dst`).
2. The `ops` parameter adjusts the opacity of the source color.
3. It calculates the resulting alpha channel and color components (r, g, b) based on the alpha compositing formula.
4. The function returns an object with the blended color values and alpha.

This operation is typically used in image processing and graphics rendering to combine layers or draw semi-transparent objects over a background.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses basic JavaScript operations and math to perform color blending calculations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `srcOver` function:

```javascript
// Define two colors: source and destination
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Opaque blue

// Call the srcOver function
const result = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log("Resulting color:", result);

// You can also specify an optional opacity parameter
const resultWithOpacity = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor, 0.8);
console.log("Result with modified opacity:", resultWithOpacity);
```

In this example:

1. We define two colors: a semi-transparent red (`sourceColor`) and an opaque blue (`destColor`).

2. We call the `srcOver` function with these two colors as arguments. This will blend the source color over the destination color.

3. The result is logged to the console. It will be a new color object representing the blended result.

4. We then demonstrate the optional third parameter by calling `srcOver` again with an opacity value of 0.8. This will modify the opacity of the source color before blending.

5. The second result is also logged to the console.

The `srcOver` function implements the "source over destination" alpha compositing operation, which is a common method for blending a foreground color (source) over a background color (destination), taking into account the alpha (transparency) values of both colors.

Remember that this function expects color objects with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties, where `r`, `g`, and `b` are in the range 0-255, and `a` is in the range 0-1.

# dstOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! In this code snippet, `dstOver` is a function that implements the "destination-over" blending mode for compositing two colors or images.

Here's a concise explanation:

1. The function takes two parameters: `src` (source color) and `dst` (destination color).
2. An optional third parameter `ops` (opacity) is provided, defaulting to 1 if not specified.
3. It adjusts the source alpha (`src.a`) by multiplying it with the opacity.
4. It then calculates the resulting color components (r, g, b, a) using the destination-over blending formula.
5. The formula ensures that the source color is placed "behind" the destination color, with proper alpha blending.
6. Finally, it returns an object with the calculated r, g, b, and a values.

This function is useful in graphics programming and image manipulation when you need to blend colors or layers using the destination-over compositing method.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it performs simple arithmetic operations using standard JavaScript syntax and features.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `dstOver` function:

```javascript
// Define source and destination colors
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Opaque blue

// Call the dstOver function
const result = dstOver(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log("Resulting color:", result);

// You can also specify an optional opacity value
const resultWithCustomOpacity = dstOver(sourceColor, destColor, 0.8);
console.log("Result with custom opacity:", resultWithCustomOpacity);
```

In this example:

1. We define two colors: a semi-transparent red (`sourceColor`) and an opaque blue (`destColor`).

2. We call the `dstOver` function with these two colors as arguments.

3. The function returns a new color object representing the result of the "destination over" composition.

4. We log the result to the console.

5. We also demonstrate how to use the optional third parameter (`ops`) by calling the function again with a custom opacity value of 0.8.

The `dstOver` function implements the "destination over" compositing operation, where the source color is placed behind the destination color. The resulting color takes into account the alpha values of both colors to create a blended result.

Remember that this function expects color objects with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties, where `r`, `g`, and `b` are typically in the range 0-255, and `a` is in the range 0-1.

# multiply node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `multiply` is a function that performs a blend operation between two color values (`src` and `dst`) using the multiply blending mode. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes two objects (`src` and `dst`) representing colors with RGBA components.
2. An optional `ops` parameter controls the intensity of the blending.
3. It calculates the resulting alpha value and pre-multiplied color components.
4. The function applies the multiply blending formula to each color channel (R, G, B).
5. Finally, it returns a new object with the blended RGBA values.

This function is typically used in image processing or graphics programming to combine colors using the multiply blending mode, which generally results in a darker image.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it performs calculations using only native JavaScript operations and object properties.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `multiply` function:

```javascript
// Define two color objects (source and destination)
const sourceColor = { r: 0.8, g: 0.5, b: 0.2, a: 0.7 };
const destColor = { r: 0.3, g: 0.6, b: 0.9, a: 0.8 };

// Call the multiply function
const result = multiply(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log(result);

// You can also use the optional third parameter (ops)
const resultWithOps = multiply(sourceColor, destColor, 1.5);
console.log(resultWithOps);
```

In this example:

1. We define two color objects, `sourceColor` and `destColor`, each with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties representing red, green, blue, and alpha channels respectively. Values should be between 0 and 1.

2. We call the `multiply` function with `sourceColor` as the first argument and `destColor` as the second argument.

3. The function returns a new color object, which we store in the `result` variable and then log to the console.

4. We also demonstrate using the optional third parameter `ops` by calling the function again with a value of 1.5.

This code will apply the multiply blending mode to the two input colors and return the resulting color. The `ops` parameter can be used to adjust the opacity of the source color before blending.

# add node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `add` is a function that performs color blending or compositing between two colors, typically used in image processing or graphics operations. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes two color objects (`src` and `dst`) as input, each with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties representing red, green, blue, and alpha channels.

2. An optional `ops` parameter controls the intensity of the source color.

3. It calculates a new alpha value `a` by combining the alpha values of both colors.

4. It then computes new red, green, and blue values by blending the source and destination colors, taking into account their alpha values.

5. Finally, it returns a new color object with the blended values.

This function essentially adds the source color on top of the destination color, considering transparency, resulting in a new composite color.
