# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous function that processes an image to remove a specific background color. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It takes an input image file path, output file path, target color to remove, and optional parameters like color threshold and additional options.

2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and manipulate the image.

3. It converts the target color to a hex value.

4. The function then scans every pixel of the image, comparing each pixel's color to the target color.

5. If a pixel's color is within the specified threshold of the target color, it sets that pixel's alpha value to 0, making it transparent.

6. Finally, it saves the processed image with the background color removed to the specified output path.

In essence, this function allows you to remove a specific background color from an image, replacing it with transparency, while providing some flexibility in color matching through the threshold parameter.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the Jimp library, which is a third-party image processing library for Node.js.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `removeBackgroundColor` function:

```javascript
const removeBackgroundColor = require('./removeBackgroundColor'); // Assuming the function is in a separate file

async function main() {
  try {
    const inputPath = './input-image.jpg';
    const outputPath = './output-image.png';
    const targetColor = '#FFFFFF'; // White background color
    const colorThreshold = 30; // Adjust this value to fine-tune the color matching

    await removeBackgroundColor(inputPath, outputPath, targetColor, colorThreshold);
    console.log('Background removal completed successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error removing background:', error);
  }
}

main();
```

In this example:

1. We import the `removeBackgroundColor` function (assuming it's in a separate file).

2. We define an async `main` function to use `await` with the asynchronous `removeBackgroundColor` function.

3. We specify the input image path, output image path, target background color (white in this case), and a color threshold.

4. We call the `removeBackgroundColor` function with these parameters.

5. If successful, it logs a success message; if there's an error, it logs the error.

6. Finally, we call the `main` function to execute our code.

Make sure to install the required dependencies (like `jimp`) before running this code. You may need to adjust the file paths, target color, and color threshold based on your specific use case.
