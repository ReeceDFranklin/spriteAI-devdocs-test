# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous function designed to remove a specific background color from an image. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It takes an input image file path, an output file path, a target color to remove, and optional parameters for color threshold and other options.

2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and process the image.

3. It converts the target color to a hexadecimal format.

4. The function then scans through each pixel of the image, comparing its color to the target color.

5. If the color difference between a pixel and the target color is within the specified threshold, it makes that pixel transparent by setting its alpha value to 0.

6. Finally, it saves the processed image with the removed background to the specified output path.

In essence, this function allows you to remove a specific background color from an image, creating transparency where that color was present, within a given tolerance threshold.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the Jimp library, which is a third-party image processing library for JavaScript.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `removeBackgroundColor` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

async function main() {
  try {
    const inputPath = 'path/to/input/image.jpg';
    const outputPath = 'path/to/output/image.png';
    const targetColor = '#FFFFFF'; // White background color
    const colorThreshold = 10; // Adjust this value as needed

    await removeBackgroundColor(inputPath, outputPath, targetColor, colorThreshold);
    console.log('Background removed successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

main();
```

In this example:

1. We import the `Jimp` library (make sure it's installed: `npm install jimp`).

2. We define a `main` function to run our code asynchronously.

3. Inside `main`, we specify:
   - `inputPath`: The path to your input image file.
   - `outputPath`: The path where you want to save the processed image.
   - `targetColor`: The background color you want to remove (in this case, white).
   - `colorThreshold`: A value to allow for slight color variations (adjust as needed).

4. We call the `removeBackgroundColor` function with these parameters.

5. If successful, it will log a success message; otherwise, it will catch and log any errors.

6. Finally, we call the `main` function to execute our code.

Make sure to replace the `inputPath` and `outputPath` with actual file paths on your system. Also, adjust the `targetColor` and `colorThreshold` as needed for your specific image.

This example assumes that the `removeBackgroundColor` function is in the same file or properly imported. If it's in a separate file, you'll need to import it at the top of your script.
