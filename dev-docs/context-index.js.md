# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function in this code snippet is an asynchronous function designed to remove a specific background color from an image. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It takes an input image file, processes it, and saves the result to an output file.

2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and manipulate the image.

3. It converts the target color (specified as a CSS color string) to a hex value.

4. The function then scans every pixel of the image, comparing each pixel's color to the target color.

5. If a pixel's color is within the specified color threshold of the target color, it sets that pixel to transparent by adjusting its alpha channel.

6. Finally, it saves the processed image with the background color removed to the specified output path.

In essence, this function automates the process of removing a specific background color from an image, making it transparent instead.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) for image processing and manipulation.
