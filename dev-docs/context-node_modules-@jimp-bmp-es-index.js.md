# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/es/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is converting an image from the standard RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color format to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) format. Here's what it does:

1. It uses a `scan` function (likely from an image processing library) to iterate over each pixel of the image.

2. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the RGBA values from the original bitmap data.
   - Reorders these values to AGBR by reassigning them in the bitmap data array.

3. The function effectively swaps the positions of the Alpha and Red channels, while keeping Green and Blue in their original positions.

This transformation can be useful in certain image processing scenarios or when working with specific file formats or systems that expect image data in AGBR format.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Assuming you have the toAGBR function defined as shown in your provided code

// Load an image
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.jpg')
  .then(image => {
    // Apply the toAGBR function to convert the image
    const agbrImage = toAGBR(image);

    // Save the converted image
    return Jimp.create(agbrImage.width, agbrImage.height)
      .then(newImage => {
        newImage.bitmap = agbrImage;
        return newImage.write('path/to/output/agbr_image.png');
      });
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image converted and saved successfully!');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

This example does the following:

1. It uses the Jimp library to read an image file.
2. Once the image is loaded, it applies the `toAGBR` function to convert the image's color channels.
3. It then creates a new Jimp image with the same dimensions as the converted image.
4. The bitmap data of the converted image is assigned to the new image.
5. Finally, it saves the new image with the AGBR color channel order.

Remember to install the Jimp library (`npm install jimp`) before running this code.

Also, make sure to replace `'path/to/your/image.jpg'` with the actual path to your input image, and `'path/to/output/agbr_image.png'` with your desired output path and filename.

This example assumes that the `toAGBR` function and any necessary dependencies (like the `scan` function) are properly defined and available in your code environment.
