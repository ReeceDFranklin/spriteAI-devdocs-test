## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function converts an image from the standard RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color format to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) format. It does this by:

1. Using a `scan` function (likely from an image processing library) to iterate over each pixel in the image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values from the image data.
3. It then reassigns these values in AGBR order:
   - Alpha becomes the first channel
   - Blue becomes the second channel
   - Green becomes the third channel
   - Red becomes the fourth channel
4. The function returns the modified image data (`.bitmap`) with the new color channel arrangement.

This transformation can be useful for certain image processing tasks or when working with systems that expect image data in AGBR format.

# fromAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/es/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `fromAGBR` function is designed to convert an image bitmap from AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) color format to RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) format. Here's what it does:

1. It takes a bitmap object as input.
2. It uses a `scan` function (not shown in the snippet) to iterate over each pixel in the bitmap.
3. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the AGBR values from the bitmap data.
   - Rearranges these values to RGBA order.
   - Writes the rearranged values back to the bitmap data.
4. If the original bitmap has an alpha channel, it preserves it; otherwise, it sets alpha to 255 (fully opaque).
5. Finally, it returns the modified bitmap with the color channels now in RGBA order.

This function is useful when working with image data that's in AGBR format but needs to be in the more common RGBA format for further processing or display.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `fromAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Assuming you have the fromAGBR function defined as shown in your original code

// Load an image in AGBR format
Jimp.read('path/to/your/agbr_image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image from AGBR to RGBA
    const convertedImage = fromAGBR(image);

    // Save the converted image
    return convertedImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/rgba_image.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image conversion completed successfully');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We use the Jimp library to read an image file that is in AGBR format.

2. Once the image is loaded, we pass it to the `fromAGBR` function, which converts the pixel format from AGBR to RGBA.

3. The converted image is then saved to a new file.

4. We use promises to handle the asynchronous operations and log the result or any errors.

Note that this example assumes you're using Jimp for image processing. If you're using a different library, you might need to adjust the code accordingly. Also, make sure that the `scan` function used in `fromAGBR` is properly defined and available in your environment.
