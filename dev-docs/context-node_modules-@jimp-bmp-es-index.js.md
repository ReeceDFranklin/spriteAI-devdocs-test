### Third Party Libaries

The `toAGBR` function itself doesn't directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it relies on the `scan` method and `bitmap` property, which suggests it's likely part of or working with an image processing library like Jimp.

# fromAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/es/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `fromAGBR` function is designed to convert an image from the AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) color format to the more standard RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) format. Here's what it does:

1. It takes a `bitmap` object as input.
2. It uses a `scan` function (not shown in the snippet) to iterate over each pixel of the image.
3. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the AGBR values from the bitmap data.
   - Rearranges these values to RGBA order.
   - Writes the rearranged values back to the bitmap data.
4. If the original bitmap has an alpha channel, it preserves it; otherwise, it sets full opacity (0xff).
5. Finally, it returns the modified bitmap with the color channels now in RGBA order.

This function is useful when dealing with image data that's in the less common AGBR format and needs to be converted to the more widely used RGBA format.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries. It appears to be using custom or pre-defined functions `fromAGBR` and `BMP.decode`, but these are not standard third-party libraries.
