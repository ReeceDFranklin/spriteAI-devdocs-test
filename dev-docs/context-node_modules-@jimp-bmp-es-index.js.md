# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/es/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is transforming the color format of an image from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red). Here's what it does:

1. It uses a `scan` function (likely from an image processing library) to iterate over every pixel in the image.

2. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the RGBA values from the original bitmap data.
   - Rearranges these values in AGBR order.
   - Writes the rearranged values back to the bitmap data.

3. This effectively swaps the positions of the alpha and red channels, while keeping green and blue in their original positions.

4. After processing all pixels, it returns the modified bitmap data.

This transformation can be useful in certain image processing tasks or when working with specific file formats or graphics APIs that expect color data in AGBR format.

### Third Party Libaries

The `toAGBR` function appears to use the `scan` method, which is likely part of a image processing library (possibly Jimp), but without more context about the full codebase or imported libraries, it's not possible to definitively state if it's using a third-party API or library.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief example of how you might use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Assuming you have the toAGBR function defined as shown in your provided code

// Load an image
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image to AGBR format
    const agbrImage = toAGBR(image);

    // Now you can use the AGBR image
    // For example, you might want to save it
    return Jimp.create(agbrImage.width, agbrImage.height)
      .then(newImage => {
        newImage.bitmap = agbrImage;
        return newImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/agbr_image.png');
      });
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('AGBR image saved successfully');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We use the Jimp library to read an image file.
2. We apply the `toAGBR` function to convert the image to AGBR format.
3. We create a new Jimp image with the same dimensions as the original.
4. We set the bitmap of the new image to our AGBR bitmap.
5. We save the new AGBR image to a file.

Note that this function modifies the pixel data of the image, changing the order of the color channels from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red). This isn't a standard image format, so you might need special handling to properly display or process the resulting image.

Also, make sure you have the `scan` function available (it's typically a method provided by image processing libraries like Jimp) for this code to work correctly.

# fromAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/es/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `fromAGBR` function is designed to convert an image from AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) color format to the more standard RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) format. Here's what it does:

1. It takes a `bitmap` object as input, which represents an image in AGBR format.

2. It uses a `scan` function (not shown in the snippet) to iterate over each pixel of the image.

3. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the AGBR values from the bitmap data.
   - Rearranges these values to RGBA order.
   - Writes the rearranged values back to the bitmap data.

4. If the original bitmap has an alpha channel (`bitmap.is_with_alpha`), it preserves the alpha value. Otherwise, it sets the alpha to 255 (fully opaque).

5. Finally, it returns the modified bitmap, now in RGBA format.

This function is essentially performing a color space conversion, reorganizing the byte order of each pixel to change the image format from AGBR to RGBA.
