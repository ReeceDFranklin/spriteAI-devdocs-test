# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/es/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is transforming an image's pixel data from the RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color format to the AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) format. Here's what it does:

1. It scans through each pixel of the image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values, writing them back in AGBR order:
   - Alpha becomes the first channel
   - Blue becomes the second channel
   - Green becomes the third channel
   - Red becomes the fourth channel

This transformation changes the way the image data is stored, which can be useful for certain image processing operations or when working with specific file formats that expect data in this order.

### Third Party Libaries

The `toAGBR` function itself doesn't directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it appears to be using a `scan` function and accessing a `bitmap` property, which suggests it's likely part of or working with an image processing library like Jimp.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Function to convert image to AGBR format
function toAGBR(image) {
  return scan(image, 0, 0, image.bitmap.width, image.bitmap.height, function (x, y, index) {
    const red = this.bitmap.data[index + 0];
    const green = this.bitmap.data[index + 1];
    const blue = this.bitmap.data[index + 2];
    const alpha = this.bitmap.data[index + 3];
    this.bitmap.data[index + 0] = alpha;
    this.bitmap.data[index + 1] = blue;
    this.bitmap.data[index + 2] = green;
    this.bitmap.data[index + 3] = red;
  }).bitmap;
}

// Example usage
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.jpg')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image to AGBR format
    const agbrBitmap = toAGBR(image);

    // Create a new Jimp image from the AGBR bitmap
    const agbrImage = new Jimp(agbrBitmap);

    // Save the AGBR image
    return agbrImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/agbr_image.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('AGBR image saved successfully');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We import the Jimp library, which is required for image processing.
2. We define the `toAGBR` function as provided in your original code.
3. We use `Jimp.read()` to load an image file.
4. Once the image is loaded, we call the `toAGBR` function to convert it to AGBR format.
5. We create a new Jimp image from the resulting AGBR bitmap.
6. We save the AGBR image to a file.
7. We handle any errors that might occur during the process.

Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/image.jpg'` with the actual path to your input image, and `'path/to/output/agbr_image.png'` with the desired output path and filename.

Also, ensure that you have the Jimp library installed in your project (`npm install jimp`) before running this code.

# fromAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/es/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `fromAGBR` function is designed to convert an image bitmap from AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) color format to the more common RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) format. Here's what it does:

1. It takes a bitmap as input.
2. It uses a `scan` function (not shown in the snippet) to iterate over each pixel in the bitmap.
3. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the AGBR values from the bitmap data.
   - Reorders these values to RGBA.
   - Writes the reordered values back to the bitmap data.
4. If the original bitmap has an alpha channel, it preserves it; otherwise, it sets alpha to fully opaque (0xff).
5. Finally, it returns the modified bitmap with the color channels now in RGBA order.

This function is useful when working with image data that's in AGBR format but needs to be in the more standard RGBA format for further processing or display.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function doesn't appear to use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only manipulates the provided bitmap data directly.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `fromAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Assume we have imported or defined the fromAGBR function somewhere

// Load an image in AGBR format
Jimp.read('path/to/your/agbr_image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image from AGBR to RGBA
    const rgbaImage = fromAGBR(image);

    // Now you can work with the RGBA image
    // For example, you can save it
    return rgbaImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/rgba_image.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image conversion complete!');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We use Jimp to read an image file that's in AGBR format.
2. We pass the loaded image to the `fromAGBR` function, which converts it to RGBA format.
3. The resulting RGBA image can then be further processed or saved.

Note that this example assumes:
- You're using Jimp for image processing.
- The `fromAGBR` function and any necessary dependencies (like the `scan` function) are properly imported or defined in your code.
- The input image is actually in AGBR format.

Remember to handle any potential errors, especially when dealing with file I/O operations.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries. It appears to be using custom or pre-defined functions `fromAGBR` and `BMP.decode`, but these are not standard third-party libraries.
