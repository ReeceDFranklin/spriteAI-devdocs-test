## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function converts an image from the standard RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color format to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) format. It does this by:

1. Using a `scan` function (likely from an image processing library) to iterate over each pixel in the image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values from the image data.
3. It then reassigns these values in AGBR order:
   - Alpha becomes the first channel
   - Blue becomes the second channel
   - Green becomes the third channel
   - Red becomes the fourth channel
4. The function returns the modified image data (`.bitmap`) with the new color channel arrangement.

This transformation can be useful for certain image processing tasks or when working with systems that expect image data in AGBR format.
