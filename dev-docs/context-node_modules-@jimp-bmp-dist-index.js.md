## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is converting an image from the standard RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color format to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) format. Here's what it does:

1. It scans through every pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values, writing them back in AGBR order.
4. This process effectively swaps the positions of the Alpha and Red channels, while keeping Green and Blue in their original positions.

The function returns the modified bitmap data of the image after this conversion.
