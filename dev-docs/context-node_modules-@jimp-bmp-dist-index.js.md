# _interopRequireDefault node_modules/@jimp/bmp/dist/index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `_interopRequireDefault`:

`_interopRequireDefault` is a helper function commonly used in transpiled JavaScript code, especially when working with ES6 modules in environments that use CommonJS.

Its purpose is to ensure consistent module importing behavior between ES6 modules and CommonJS modules. It does this by:

1. Checking if the imported module has an `__esModule` flag (indicating it's an ES6 module).
2. If it is an ES6 module, it returns the module as-is.
3. If it's not an ES6 module (likely a CommonJS module), it wraps the module in an object with a `default` property.

This allows code to consistently use `module.default` to access the main export, regardless of whether the original module used ES6 `export default` or CommonJS `module.exports`.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it's a simple JavaScript utility function that handles default exports in ES6 modules.

### Code Example

Certainly! The `_interopRequireDefault` function is commonly used in JavaScript modules, particularly when working with CommonJS modules and ES6 modules together. Here's a brief example of how you might use this function:

```javascript
// Assuming this is in a file called "myModule.js"

// Import a module
const someModule = require('some-module');

// Use _interopRequireDefault
const _interopRequireDefault = require("@babel/runtime/helpers/interopRequireDefault");
const _someModule = _interopRequireDefault(someModule);

// Now you can use the default export like this:
_someModule.default.someMethod();

// If it's not an ES module, you can still use it normally:
_someModule.someMethod();
```

In this example:

1. We import a module using CommonJS `require`.
2. We apply `_interopRequireDefault` to the imported module.
3. The resulting `_someModule` will have a `default` property if the original module was an ES6 module with a default export.
4. If the original module wasn't an ES6 module, `_someModule` will be essentially the same as `someModule`.

This function is particularly useful when you're working in an environment where you might receive both CommonJS and ES6 modules, and you want to handle them consistently. It ensures that you always have a `default` property to work with, regardless of how the module was originally exported.

Note that in many modern JavaScript setups, this function is often handled automatically by build tools or transpilers, so you might not need to use it directly in your code.

# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/dist/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is transforming the color format of an image from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red). Here's what it does:

1. It scans through every pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values, writing them back in AGBR order.

This transformation changes the byte order of each pixel's color data, which can be useful for certain image processing operations or when working with specific file formats or hardware that expect color data in this arrangement.

### Third Party Libaries

The function itself doesn't directly use third-party APIs or libraries, but it does use a `scan` function imported from a `_utils` module, which could potentially be from a third-party library depending on its origin.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');
const { toAGBR } = require('./your-module'); // Assuming the toAGBR function is in a separate file

// Load an image
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image to AGBR format
    const agbrImage = toAGBR(image);

    // Save the converted image
    return Jimp.create(agbrImage.width, agbrImage.height)
      .then(newImage => {
        newImage.bitmap = agbrImage;
        return newImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/agbr_image.png');
      });
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image converted and saved successfully!');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We import the necessary modules, including Jimp for image processing and the file containing the `toAGBR` function.

2. We use `Jimp.read()` to load an image file.

3. Once the image is loaded, we call the `toAGBR` function, passing the loaded image as an argument. This converts the image to the AGBR format.

4. We create a new Jimp image with the same dimensions as the original and set its bitmap to the converted AGBR bitmap.

5. Finally, we save the new image to a file.

6. We use promises to handle asynchronous operations and log the result or any errors.

Remember to replace `'path/to/your/image.png'` with the actual path to your input image, and `'path/to/output/agbr_image.png'` with the desired output path and filename.

Also, make sure you have Jimp installed in your project (`npm install jimp`) and that the `toAGBR` function is properly exported from its module.
