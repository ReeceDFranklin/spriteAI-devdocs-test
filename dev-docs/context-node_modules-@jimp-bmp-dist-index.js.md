## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is converting an image from the standard RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color format to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) format. Here's what it does:

1. It scans through every pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values, writing them back in AGBR order.
4. This process effectively swaps the positions of the Alpha and Red channels, while keeping Green and Blue in their original positions.

The function returns the modified bitmap data of the image after this conversion.

## Imported Code Object
The `fromAGBR` function appears to be a color format conversion function. It takes a bitmap image with pixels in AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) format and converts it to RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) format, which is a more common color representation.

Here's what it does:

1. It scans through all pixels of the input bitmap.
2. For each pixel, it reorders the color components from AGBR to RGBA.
3. If the original bitmap has an alpha channel (`bitmap.is_with_alpha` is true), it preserves the alpha value. Otherwise, it sets the alpha to 255 (fully opaque).
4. It returns the modified bitmap with the new color order.

This function is useful when working with image data that's in AGBR format but needs to be in the more standard RGBA format for further processing or display.

### Third Party Libaries

The function `fromAGBR` does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it does use a `scan` function imported from a `_utils` module, which could potentially be part of a library or a custom utility module.
