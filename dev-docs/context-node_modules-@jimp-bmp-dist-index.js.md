## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is used to convert an image's color format from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red). Here's a concise explanation:

1. It scans through each pixel of the image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values to AGBR order.
4. The function modifies the image data in-place.
5. Finally, it returns the modified bitmap data of the image.

This conversion can be useful in certain image processing tasks or when working with specific file formats or systems that expect the color data in AGBR format.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');
const { toAGBR } = require('./your-module'); // Assuming the toAGBR function is in a separate file

async function convertToAGBR() {
  try {
    // Load an image
    const image = await Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.png');

    // Apply the toAGBR function
    const agbrImage = toAGBR(image);

    // Save the converted image
    await Jimp.write(agbrImage, 'path/to/output/agbr_image.png');

    console.log('Image converted to AGBR format and saved successfully.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

convertToAGBR();
```

In this example:

1. We import the necessary modules, including Jimp for image processing and the file containing the `toAGBR` function.

2. We define an async function `convertToAGBR` to handle the image conversion process.

3. Inside the function, we use `Jimp.read()` to load an image file.

4. We apply the `toAGBR` function to the loaded image.

5. We save the converted image using `Jimp.write()`.

6. Finally, we call the `convertToAGBR` function to execute the conversion process.

Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/image.png'` with the actual path to your input image, and `'path/to/output/agbr_image.png'` with the desired output path for the converted image.

Also, ensure that you have the Jimp library installed (`npm install jimp`) and that the `toAGBR` function is properly exported from its module before running this code.

### Third Party Libaries

The function `fromAGBR` appears to use a utility function called `scan` from a module named `_utils`, which could be a custom utility or part of a library, but without more context, it's not possible to definitively state if it's using any third-party APIs or libraries.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `fromAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');
const { fromAGBR } = require('./your-module'); // Adjust the path as needed

// Load an image in AGBR format
Jimp.read('path/to/your/agbr-image.png')
  .then((image) => {
    // Convert the image from AGBR to RGBA
    const rgbaImage = fromAGBR(image);

    // Now you can work with the RGBA image
    // For example, you can save it
    return rgbaImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/rgba-image.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image conversion completed and saved.');
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We import the necessary modules, including Jimp for image handling and the module containing the `fromAGBR` function.

2. We use `Jimp.read()` to load an image file that's in AGBR format.

3. Once the image is loaded, we pass it to the `fromAGBR` function, which converts it from AGBR to RGBA format.

4. After conversion, we can perform further operations on the image. In this example, we're saving the converted image to a new file.

5. We use promise chaining to handle the asynchronous operations and catch any errors that might occur.

Remember to replace `'./your-module'` with the actual path to the module containing the `fromAGBR` function, and adjust the input and output file paths as needed.

This code assumes that the `fromAGBR` function is exported from its module and that you're using a JavaScript environment that supports ES6 syntax and promises (like Node.js).
