# _interopRequireDefault node_modules/@jimp/bmp/dist/index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `_interopRequireDefault`:

`_interopRequireDefault` is a helper function commonly used in transpiled JavaScript code, especially when working with ES6 modules and CommonJS. Its purpose is to ensure consistent module importing behavior across different module systems.

The function does the following:

1. It checks if the imported module (`obj`) exists and has an `__esModule` property set to `true`.
2. If both conditions are met, it returns the module as-is.
3. If not, it returns an object with the original module assigned to a `default` property.

This helps normalize the way modules are imported, allowing both ES6-style default imports and CommonJS-style requires to work consistently in transpiled code.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries. It's a simple JavaScript utility function that checks if an object has an `__esModule` property and returns either the object itself or an object with a `default` property containing the original object.

### Code Example

Certainly! The `_interopRequireDefault` function is commonly used in JavaScript modules, particularly when working with CommonJS and ES modules interoperability. Here's a brief example of how to use it:

```javascript
// Assume this is in a file named "example.js"

// Import the _interopRequireDefault function
const _interopRequireDefault = require("@babel/runtime/helpers/interopRequireDefault");

// Import some module
const someModule = require("some-module");

// Use _interopRequireDefault
const _someModule = _interopRequireDefault(someModule);

// Now you can use the default export like this:
_someModule.default.someMethod();

// If someModule was an ES module with a default export, you could also do:
const { default: SomeClass } = _someModule;
const instance = new SomeClass();
```

In this example:

1. We import the `_interopRequireDefault` function (often this is done automatically by build tools like Babel).

2. We import some module using `require()`.

3. We pass the imported module through `_interopRequireDefault`.

4. We can then access the default export using `.default`, or destructure it.

The main purpose of `_interopRequireDefault` is to normalize how you access the default export of a module, regardless of whether it's a CommonJS module or an ES module. This is particularly useful in environments where you might be mixing different module systems.

Note that in many projects using modern build tools, you might not need to use `_interopRequireDefault` directly, as it's often handled automatically during the build process.

# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/dist/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is converting an image from the standard RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color format to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) format. Here's what it does:

1. It scans through every pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values, writing them back in AGBR order.
4. This process effectively swaps the positions of the Alpha and Red channels, while keeping Green and Blue in their original positions.

The function returns the modified bitmap data of the image after this conversion.

### Third Party Libaries

The function itself does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it does use a `scan` function imported from a `_utils` module, which may be part of a larger library or framework.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');
const { toAGBR } = require('./your-module'); // Assuming the toAGBR function is in a separate file

async function convertImageToAGBR() {
  try {
    // Load an image
    const image = await Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.png');

    // Apply the toAGBR function
    const agbrImage = toAGBR(image);

    // Save the converted image
    await Jimp.write('path/to/output/agbr_image.png', agbrImage);

    console.log('Image converted to AGBR format and saved successfully.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

convertImageToAGBR();
```

In this example:

1. We import the necessary modules: Jimp for image processing and the custom module containing the `toAGBR` function.

2. We define an async function `convertImageToAGBR` to handle the image conversion process.

3. Inside the function, we use `Jimp.read()` to load an image from a file.

4. We apply the `toAGBR` function to the loaded image, which converts the pixel format from RGBA to AGBR.

5. We then use `Jimp.write()` to save the converted image to a new file.

6. Finally, we call the `convertImageToAGBR` function to execute the conversion process.

Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/image.png'` with the actual path to your input image, and `'path/to/output/agbr_image.png'` with the desired output path and filename.

Also, ensure that you have the Jimp library installed (`npm install jimp`) and that the `toAGBR` function is properly exported from its module.

This example demonstrates how to use the `toAGBR` function to convert an image from the standard RGBA format to the AGBR format, which can be useful for certain image processing tasks or when working with specific file formats that require this pixel arrangement.

# fromAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/dist/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `fromAGBR` function appears to be a conversion function that transforms an image bitmap from AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) color format to RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) format.

Here's what it does:

1. It takes a `bitmap` as input.
2. It uses a `scan` utility function (likely from a library) to iterate over each pixel of the bitmap.
3. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the AGBR values from the input bitmap data.
   - Reorders these values to RGBA format in the output.
   - Sets the alpha channel to either the original alpha value or 255 (fully opaque) if the bitmap doesn't use alpha.
4. It returns the modified bitmap with the color channels now in RGBA order.

This function is essentially performing a color channel swap and potentially adjusting the alpha channel for images that were originally in AGBR format.

### Third Party Libaries

The function `fromAGBR` does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it does use a `scan` function imported from a `_utils` module, which could potentially be part of a library or internal utility module.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief example of how you might use the `fromAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');
const { fromAGBR } = require('./your-module'); // Assuming the function is in a separate module

// Load an image
Jimp.read('path/to/your/agbr_image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert from AGBR to RGBA
    const convertedImage = fromAGBR(image);

    // Save the converted image
    return convertedImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/rgba_image.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image conversion completed and saved.');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We import the necessary modules, including Jimp for image processing and the module containing the `fromAGBR` function.

2. We use `Jimp.read()` to load an image file that's in AGBR format.

3. Once the image is loaded, we pass it to the `fromAGBR` function, which converts the pixel format from AGBR to RGBA.

4. We then save the converted image using the `writeAsync` method.

5. Finally, we handle the promise chain, logging a success message or any errors that occur.

Note that this example assumes you're working in a Node.js environment and have Jimp installed (`npm install jimp`). Also, make sure to replace `'./your-module'` with the actual path to the module containing the `fromAGBR` function.

This code will take an image in AGBR format, convert it to RGBA, and save the result as a new file. The original image remains unchanged, and a new image with the converted color format is created.
