## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is transforming the color format of an image from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red). Here's what it does:

1. It scans through every pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values, writing them back in AGBR order.

This transformation changes the byte order of each pixel's color data, which can be useful for certain image processing operations or when working with specific file formats or hardware that expect color data in this arrangement.

### Third Party Libaries

The function itself doesn't directly use third-party APIs or libraries, but it does use a `scan` function imported from a `_utils` module, which could potentially be from a third-party library depending on its origin.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');
const { toAGBR } = require('./your-module'); // Assuming the toAGBR function is in a separate file

// Load an image
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image to AGBR format
    const agbrImage = toAGBR(image);

    // Save the converted image
    return Jimp.create(agbrImage.width, agbrImage.height)
      .then(newImage => {
        newImage.bitmap = agbrImage;
        return newImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/agbr_image.png');
      });
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image converted and saved successfully!');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We import the necessary modules, including Jimp for image processing and the file containing the `toAGBR` function.

2. We use `Jimp.read()` to load an image file.

3. Once the image is loaded, we call the `toAGBR` function, passing the loaded image as an argument. This converts the image to the AGBR format.

4. We create a new Jimp image with the same dimensions as the original and set its bitmap to the converted AGBR bitmap.

5. Finally, we save the new image to a file.

6. We use promises to handle asynchronous operations and log the result or any errors.

Remember to replace `'path/to/your/image.png'` with the actual path to your input image, and `'path/to/output/agbr_image.png'` with the desired output path and filename.

Also, make sure you have Jimp installed in your project (`npm install jimp`) and that the `toAGBR` function is properly exported from its module.
