# _interopRequireDefault node_modules/@jimp/bmp/dist/index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `_interopRequireDefault`:

`_interopRequireDefault` is a helper function commonly used in transpiled JavaScript code, especially when working with ES6 modules in environments that don't natively support them. Its purpose is to ensure consistent module importing behavior between ES6 modules and CommonJS modules.

The function does the following:

1. It checks if the imported module (`obj`) exists and has an `__esModule` property set to `true`.
2. If so, it returns the module as-is, assuming it's an ES6 module.
3. If not, it wraps the module in an object with a `default` property, making it mimic the structure of an ES6 default export.

This function helps normalize the way modules are imported, allowing code to consistently use the `.default` property when accessing the main export of a module, regardless of whether it's an ES6 module or a CommonJS module.

### Third Party Libaries

No, the `_interopRequireDefault` function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it's a simple utility function that handles CommonJS and ES module interoperability within JavaScript code.

### Code Example

Certainly! The `_interopRequireDefault` function is commonly used in JavaScript modules, particularly when working with CommonJS modules and ES6 modules together. Here's a brief example of how you might use this function:

```javascript
// Assuming this is in a file named "myModule.js"

// Import a module
const someModule = require('some-module');

// Use _interopRequireDefault
const _interopRequireDefault = require("@babel/runtime/helpers/interopRequireDefault");
const _someModule = _interopRequireDefault(someModule);

// Now you can use the default export like this:
_someModule.default.someMethod();

// Or if you're sure it's the default export, you could do:
const SomeModule = _interopRequireDefault(require('some-module')).default;
SomeModule.someMethod();
```

In this example:

1. We import a module using CommonJS `require`.
2. We apply `_interopRequireDefault` to the imported module.
3. This ensures that whether the imported module is a CommonJS module or an ES6 module with a default export, we can access its contents in a consistent way.

The main purpose of `_interopRequireDefault` is to normalize how you access the exports of a module, regardless of whether it's using CommonJS (`module.exports`) or ES6 (`export default`) syntax. It's particularly useful in environments where you might be mixing these two module systems.

Note that in most modern JavaScript environments, you wouldn't typically need to use this function directly. It's often used behind the scenes by build tools like Babel when transpiling ES6 modules to CommonJS.

# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/dist/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is transforming the color format of an image from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red). Here's what it does:

1. It scans through every pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values, writing them back in AGBR order.

This transformation changes the byte order of each pixel's color data, which can be useful for certain image processing operations or when working with specific file formats or hardware that expect color data in this arrangement.

### Third Party Libaries

The function itself doesn't directly use third-party APIs or libraries, but it does use a `scan` function imported from a `_utils` module, which could potentially be from a third-party library depending on its origin.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');
const { toAGBR } = require('./your-module'); // Assuming the toAGBR function is in a separate file

// Load an image
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image to AGBR format
    const agbrImage = toAGBR(image);

    // Save the converted image
    return Jimp.create(agbrImage.width, agbrImage.height)
      .then(newImage => {
        newImage.bitmap = agbrImage;
        return newImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/agbr_image.png');
      });
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image converted and saved successfully!');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We import the necessary modules, including Jimp for image processing and the file containing the `toAGBR` function.

2. We use `Jimp.read()` to load an image file.

3. Once the image is loaded, we call the `toAGBR` function, passing the loaded image as an argument. This converts the image to the AGBR format.

4. We create a new Jimp image with the same dimensions as the original and set its bitmap to the converted AGBR bitmap.

5. Finally, we save the new image to a file.

6. We use promises to handle asynchronous operations and log the result or any errors.

Remember to replace `'path/to/your/image.png'` with the actual path to your input image, and `'path/to/output/agbr_image.png'` with the desired output path and filename.

Also, make sure you have Jimp installed in your project (`npm install jimp`) and that the `toAGBR` function is properly exported from its module.
