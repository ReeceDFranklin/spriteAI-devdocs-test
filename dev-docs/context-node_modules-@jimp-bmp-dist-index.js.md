# _interopRequireDefault node_modules/@jimp/bmp/dist/index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `_interopRequireDefault`:

`_interopRequireDefault` is a helper function commonly used in JavaScript modules, especially when working with CommonJS and ES modules interoperability. Its purpose is to ensure that imported modules are always treated as objects with a `default` export, even if they were not originally defined as such.

The function works as follows:

1. If the input `obj` is falsy (null, undefined, etc.), it returns the input as-is.
2. If `obj` has an `__esModule` property (indicating it's an ES module), it returns the object as-is.
3. Otherwise, it wraps the input in an object with a `default` property, making it compatible with ES module imports.

This function helps standardize module imports, allowing code to consistently use the `.default` property when accessing the main export of a module, regardless of whether it was defined using CommonJS or ES module syntax.

### Third Party Libaries

No, the `_interopRequireDefault` function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it's a simple utility function that handles CommonJS and ES module exports compatibility without external dependencies.

### Code Example

Certainly! The `_interopRequireDefault` function is commonly used in transpiled JavaScript code, especially when dealing with ES6 modules in environments that don't natively support them. Here's a brief example of how it might be used:

```javascript
// Assume this is in a file named "helper.js"
const _interopRequireDefault = function(obj) {
  return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj };
};

// Simulating an import statement
const someModule = require('./someModule');

// Using _interopRequireDefault
const _someModule = _interopRequireDefault(someModule);

// Now you can use the default export like this:
_someModule.default.someMethod();

// If someModule was an ES6 module with a default export,
// this would be equivalent to:
// import someModule from './someModule';
// someModule.someMethod();
```

In this example:

1. We define the `_interopRequireDefault` function.

2. We simulate importing a module using CommonJS `require`.

3. We pass the imported module through `_interopRequireDefault`.

4. The resulting `_someModule` object will have a `default` property that contains the module's exports.

This function is particularly useful when you're working in an environment that mixes CommonJS and ES6 module systems. It ensures that whether you're dealing with a module that uses `module.exports` (CommonJS) or `export default` (ES6), you can consistently access the main export via `.default`.

In practice, you typically wouldn't write this function yourself. It's usually added automatically by transpilers like Babel when converting ES6 module syntax to CommonJS for environments that don't support ES6 modules natively.

# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/dist/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is transforming the color format of an image from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red). Here's what it does:

1. It scans through every pixel of the input image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values, writing them back in AGBR order.

This transformation changes the byte order of each pixel's color data, which can be useful for certain image processing operations or when working with specific file formats or hardware that expect color data in this arrangement.

### Third Party Libaries

The function itself doesn't directly use third-party APIs or libraries, but it does use a `scan` function imported from a `_utils` module, which could potentially be from a third-party library depending on its origin.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');
const { toAGBR } = require('./your-module'); // Assuming the toAGBR function is in a separate file

// Load an image
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.png')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image to AGBR format
    const agbrImage = toAGBR(image);

    // Save the converted image
    return Jimp.create(agbrImage.width, agbrImage.height)
      .then(newImage => {
        newImage.bitmap = agbrImage;
        return newImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/agbr_image.png');
      });
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image converted and saved successfully!');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We import the necessary modules, including Jimp for image processing and the file containing the `toAGBR` function.

2. We use `Jimp.read()` to load an image file.

3. Once the image is loaded, we call the `toAGBR` function, passing the loaded image as an argument. This converts the image to the AGBR format.

4. We create a new Jimp image with the same dimensions as the original and set its bitmap to the converted AGBR bitmap.

5. Finally, we save the new image to a file.

6. We use promises to handle asynchronous operations and log the result or any errors.

Remember to replace `'path/to/your/image.png'` with the actual path to your input image, and `'path/to/output/agbr_image.png'` with the desired output path and filename.

Also, make sure you have Jimp installed in your project (`npm install jimp`) and that the `toAGBR` function is properly exported from its module.
